* Implement a timer by libc

There use =timer_create= and =timer_delete= from =time.h= to implement timer.

** SYNOPSIS

#+BEGIN_SRC c
       #include <signal.h>
       #include <time.h>

       int timer_create(clockid_t clockid, struct sigevent *restrict evp,
           timer_t *restrict timerid);
       int timer_delete(timer_t timerid);
#+END_SRC

=clockid= use =CLOCK_MONOTONIC=, a nonsettable monotonically increasing clock
that measures time from some unspecified point in the past that does not change after system startup.

=sevp.sigev_notify= try =SIGEV_SIGNAL= and =SIGEV_THREAD= to implement.
